## Introduction

As many journalists and pop music enthusiasts have <a href="https://voiceskopje.org/2022/03/25/the-music-industry-has-a-name-and-its-taylor-swift/"> remarked</a>, "Taylor Swift is the music industry." She started her music career 16 years ago, and has released 10 big albums, plus many other singles and special records, for a total of over 200 songs. She has changed genres and styles many times in order to keep up with trends, and she has consistently topped the charts with each new release. Since she has so much music, I thought it would be interesting to see what her most popular songs have in common, and how they differ from her less popular music. 

In order to gather the data, I gained access to the Spotify API, where I was able to get information about each of Taylor Swift's albums. Because this data comes from an API, we don't have to worry about violating any web-scraping rules, because they wouldn't give us access to anything they didn't want us to have. 

The first step in getting this data was to load the required packages and connect to the API.

Then, in order to access the right albums, I found and copied all of the Spotify URIs for each album. This is a unique key for identification, and each artist, album, song, playlist, and user has its own URI. I put them all into a list so that I could iterate through them.

Once I had all of the data loaded into one table, I had to do a lot of data cleaning to get the information into a format I was able to use. I won't bore you with the details, but in the end, the final dataset includes six variables: Title, Album, Track Number, Rating, Play Count, and Duration in Seconds.

Obviously I won't be analyzing for causation, but I would like to see how these different factors correlate to song popularity. I will be using play count to measure song popularity, but I may have to find a way to standardize, since we would expect the older songs to have a higher play count. I'm not sure yet what I'll find, but I'll be interested to see where in the rankings my personal favorite songs fall. From the knowledge I have of Taylor Swift's music and career, I think that her middle few albums (Red, 1989, and Reputation) will be the most popular, and I think that each track 5 will be one of the most popular songs on its respective album. There's a lot of information here to uncover, and I'm excited to see where the data takes us!
