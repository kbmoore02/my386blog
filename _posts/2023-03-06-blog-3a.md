## Introduction

As many journalists and pop music enthusiasts have <a href="https://voiceskopje.org/2022/03/25/the-music-industry-has-a-name-and-its-taylor-swift/"> remarked</a>, "Taylor Swift is the music industry." She started her music career 16 years ago, and has released 10 big albums, plus many other singles and special records, for a total of over 200 songs. She has changed genres and styles many times in order to keep up with trends, and she has consistently <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> topped the charts</a> with each new release. Since she has so much music, I thought it would be interesting to see what her most popular songs have in common, and how they differ from her less popular music.

## Data Collection

### Tools

I used Python (Jupyter Notebooks) to get data from both a the Spotify API and a Billboards Hot 100 page. I ensured that I was allowed to gather and use this data by checking the API documentation and the robots.txt page for Billboards. 

### Step 1: Gaining Access to the API

I used the free <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/spotify-api#documentation-tab"> Spotify API</a> available from APILayer. It's pretty simple to set up an account, and once you do, you can subscribe to all sorts of different APIs.

For each one you sign up for, you'll get a unique API key.

This is how you'll connect to each specific API from whatever coding platform you're using (in this case, Python Jupyter Notebooks).

```python
apikey = "it's a secret"

payload = {}
headers = {'apikey': apikey}

base_url = "https://api.apilayer.com/spotify/"
endpoint_url = "album_tracks"
album_url = "album_metadata"
```



The first step in getting this data was to load the required packages and connect to the API.

Then, in order to access the right albums, I found and copied all of the Spotify URIs for each album. This is a unique key for identification, and each artist, album, song, playlist, and user has its own URI. I put them all into a list so that I could iterate through them.

Once I had all of the data loaded into one table, I had to do a lot of data cleaning to get the information into a format I was able to use. I won't bore you with the details, but in the end, the final dataset includes six variables: Title, Album, Track Number, Rating, Play Count, and Duration in Seconds.

Obviously I won't be analyzing for causation, but I would like to see how these different factors correlate to song popularity. I will be using play count to measure song popularity, but I may have to find a way to standardize, since we would expect the older songs to have a higher play count. I'm not sure yet what I'll find, but I'll be interested to see where in the rankings my personal favorite songs fall. From the knowledge I have of Taylor Swift's music and career, I think that her middle few albums (Red, 1989, and Reputation) will be the most popular, and I think that each track 5 will be one of the most popular songs on its respective album. There's a lot of information here to uncover, and I'm excited to see where the data takes us!

All of my code as well as the full dataset can be found <a href="https://github.com/kbmoore02/Blog_3.git"> here </a>.
