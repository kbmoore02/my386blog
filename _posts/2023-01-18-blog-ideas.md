For my how-to post, I'm thinking about writing about how to use the ggplot package to create aesthetically pleasing graphs. I've had a lot of experience this past summer using ggplot to display data from the research I was working on, and I think there's a lot of funtionality in ggplot that people don't know about, which could greately improve their data visualization and ability to extrapolate from those images.

I am planning on reading a book called "The Age of Surveillance Capitalism" by Shoshana Zuboff.

I haven't thought much about the class project yet, but I think it would be interesting to gather data about the ozone layer and see how human efforts to improve pollution affected the healing of the hole in the ozone.
