## Introduction

So far in this project, I have gathered data about all of Taylor Swift's songs. I got this information from the <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/spotify-api#documentation-tab"> Spotify API</a> and from two websites, the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> Billboard Hot 100</a> and <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/taylor-swift/2023/state-farm-stadium-glendale-az-bbb91ce.html"> SetListFM</a>. To see the steps I took, check out <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> this post</a>. After compiling all the data and cleaning it up, I had a dataframe with the following information: Song Title, Album, Track Number, Play Count, Duration in Seconds, Peak Chart Position, Weeks on Chart, Single, Music Video, and Set List. 

Once I had my dataset, I performed some exploratory data analysis, comparing the relationships between all of the pairs of variables. Some of them did not tell me anything particularly interesting, such as the relationships between whether songs were released as singles, if they were made into music videos, and if they were on the Eras Tour set list. Some patterns told us a bit more, such as the relationships between play count and chart metrics. You can look at all of the analysis I did <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/21/blog-3b.html"> here</a>, but for this post, we're just going to look at the relationships that I found to be the most interesting and informative.

## What Story Does the Data Tell Us?
