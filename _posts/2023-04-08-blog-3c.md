## Introduction

So far in this project, I have gathered data about all of Taylor Swift's songs. I got this information from the <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/spotify-api#documentation-tab"> Spotify API</a> and from two websites, the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> Billboard Hot 100</a> and <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/taylor-swift/2023/state-farm-stadium-glendale-az-bbb91ce.html"> SetListFM</a>. To see the steps I took, check out <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> this post</a>. After compiling all the data and cleaning it up, I had a dataframe with the following information: Song Title, Album, Track Number, Play Count, Duration in Seconds, Peak Chart Position, Weeks on Chart, Single, Music Video, and Set List. 

Once I had my dataset, I performed some exploratory data analysis, comparing the relationships between all of the pairs of variables. Some of them did not tell me anything particularly interesting, such as the relationships between whether songs were released as singles, if they were made into music videos, and if they were on the Eras Tour set list. Some patterns told us a bit more, such as the relationships between play count and chart metrics. You can look at all of the analysis I did <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/21/blog-3b.html"> here</a>, but for this post, we're just going to look at the relationships that I found to be the most interesting and informative.

## What Story Does the Data Tell Us?

There were two patterns that I found to be particularly illuminating, so I have created two graphic, one for each.

This graph shows us the relationship between track number and play count (popularity), separated by whether the song was included on the Eras Tour set list on opening night. We see that songs which were on the set list consistently have higher average play counts (play count data was collected before the tour started, so it is not affected by the tour itself). It seems that Taylor chose to play as many of her "popular" songs as she could, mostly avoiding ones that too many (non-super-fan) people would not know. We also see in this graphic that she did not play any songs that were past track 15. Most of her albums are under 15 tracks, with the noteable exceptions of Fearless and Red, which are the two albums she has rereleased. These albums contain songs from the vault, or songs which had not been previously released, which have been much appreciated by the fans, but which seem not to have been popular enough to include on the set list.

This graphic demonstrates the relationship between play count, album length, and number of songs played on the Eras Tour. We can see that the lines representing number of songs on album and number of songs from the album played on tour follow a very similar pattern. The number of songs from each album played on tour are roughly proportionate to the number of songs on each album, although the pattern is not entirely consistent. For instance, Taylor only played 1 song from Speak Now, which has 17 songs, but she played 3 songs from Reputation, which has 15 songs. She also played 9 out of 17 songs from Folklore, which is the only album to break away from the pattern I've described. We also see in this graph that 1989 and Reputation are her two most popular albums. 1989 was her transition into pop music, which has a wider audience than country music, so it makes sense that these two would be the most popular. We also see that her most recent album, Midnights, has already surpassed 6 out of the other 10 albums, even though it has only been out for 6 months. This makes a lot of sense when you remember that it broke numerous records for streaming services, Spotify among them, as well as the charts. 

## Conclusion

Over the past 17 years, Taylor Swift has had a very successful career. She has released 10 big albums, as well as many other singles and small records. Impressively, she has managed to maintain and even grow her popularity through several genre shifts and "eras" of her life. Her Eras Tour, although only just starting, is already set to smash the previous record for highest grossing stadium tour (which was already held by her for the Reputation tour). I remember a friend remarking last November, when Spotify wrapped was released, that he had seen very few people without Taylor Swift as one of their top artists, and I think that's all you really need to know to understand her impact on the music industry.
