## Introduction

So far in this project, I have gathered data about all of Taylor Swift's songs. I got this information from the <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/spotify-api#documentation-tab"> Spotify API</a> and from two websites, the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> Billboard Hot 100</a> and <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/taylor-swift/2023/state-farm-stadium-glendale-az-bbb91ce.html"> SetListFM</a>. To see the steps I took, check out <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> this post</a>. After compiling all the data and cleaning it up, I had a dataframe with the following information: Song Title, Album, Track Number, Play Count, Duration in Seconds, Peak Chart Position, Weeks on Chart, Single, Music Video, and Set List. 

Once I had my dataset, I performed some exploratory data analysis, comparing the relationships between all of the pairs of variables. Some of them did not tell me anything particularly interesting, such as the relationships between whether songs were released as singles, if they were made into music videos, and if they were on the Eras Tour set list. Some patterns told us a bit more, such as the relationships between play count and chart metrics. You can look at all of the analysis I did <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/21/blog-3b.html"> here</a>, but for this post, we're just going to look at the relationships that I found to be the most interesting and informative.

## What Story Does the Data Tell Us?

There were two patterns that I found to be particularly illuminating, so I have created two graphic, one for each.

This graph shows us the relationship between track number and play count (popularity), separated by whether the song was included on the Eras Tour set list on opening night. We see that songs which were on the set list consistently have higher average play counts (play count data was collected before the tour started, so it is not affected by the tour itself). It seems that Taylor chose to play as many of her "popular" songs as she could, mostly avoiding ones that too many (non-super-fan) people would not know. We also see in this graphic that she did not play any songs that were past track 15. Most of her albums are under 15 tracks, with the noteable exceptions of Fearless and Red, which are the two albums she has rereleased. These albums contain songs from the vault, or songs which had not been previously released, which have been much appreciated by the fans, but which seem not to have been popular enough to include on the set list.

This graphic demonstrates the relationship between play count, album length, and number of songs played on the Eras Tour. We can see that the lines representing number of songs on album and number of songs from the album played on tour follow a very similar pattern. Include another line for ratio?
