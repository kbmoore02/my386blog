## What is Bayesian Inference?

In traditional statistical analysis, we draw conclusions based solely on sample data. Unfortunately, this limits our ability to make definitive inference. For example, we make confidence intervals, saying that we are some percent "confident" that the population parameter is within the determined bounds - we cannot say that there is some "probability" that the population parameter is within those bounds. Bayesian inference allows us to speak of population parameters in terms of probability, saying, for example, that there is some percent chance that the population parameter is within the determined bounds.

### Components of Bayesian Inference

Performing Bayesian inference involves four distributions: the prior distribution of the desired parameter, the likelihood of the collected data given the parameters, the marginal likelihood of the data, and the posterior distribution. They relate to each other as follows:

```math
\pi(\theta|y)
```


```math
Posterior = \frac{Likelihood \times Prior}{MarginalLikelihood} \rightarrow \pi(\theta|y) = \frac{f(y|\theta)\pi(\theta)}{f(y)}
```
