## What is Bayesian Inference?

In traditional statistical analysis, we draw conclusions based solely on sample data. Unfortunately, this limits our ability to make definitive inference. For example, we make confidence intervals, saying that we are some percent "confident" that the population parameter is within the determind bounds - we cannot say that there is some "probability" that the population parameter is within those bounds. Bayesian inference allows us to speak of population parameters in terms of probability, saying, for example, that there is some percent chance that the population parameter is within the determined bounds.
