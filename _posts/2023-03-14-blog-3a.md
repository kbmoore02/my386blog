## Introduction

As many journalists and pop music enthusiasts have <a href="https://voiceskopje.org/2022/03/25/the-music-industry-has-a-name-and-its-taylor-swift/"> remarked</a>, "Taylor Swift is the music industry." She started her music career 16 years ago, and has released 10 big albums, plus many other singles and special records, for a total of over 200 songs. She has changed genres and styles many times in order to keep up with trends, and she has consistently <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> topped the charts</a> with each new release. She even has so much influence that the city of Glendale, Arizona <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/03/13/glendale-az-name-change-taylor-swift-eras-tour/69995759007/"> changed its name</a> to Swift City temporarily for the opening weekend of Taylor's Eras Tour (March 17-18, 2023). Since she has so much music, I thought it would be interesting to see what her most popular songs have in common, and how they differ from her less popular music.

## Data Collection

### Tools

I used Python (Jupyter Notebooks) to get data from both the Spotify API and a Billboards Hot 100 page. I ensured that I was allowed to gather and use this data by checking the API documentation and the robots.txt page for Billboards. 

```python
import requests as rq
import pandas as pd
import re
import numpy as np
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup as bs
````

### Step 1: Gaining Access to the API

I used the free <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/spotify-api#documentation-tab"> Spotify API</a> available from APILayer. It's pretty simple to set up an account, and once you do, you can subscribe to all sorts of different APIs. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/api-1.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;">

For each one you sign up for, you'll get a unique API key. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/api-2.jpg" alt="" style="width:700px;">

This is how you'll connect to each specific API from whatever coding platform you're using (in this case, Python Jupyter Notebooks). 

```python
apikey = "it's a secret"

payload = {}
headers = {'apikey': apikey}

base_url = "https://api.apilayer.com/spotify/"
endpoint_url = "album_tracks"
album_url = "album_metadata"
```
Most APIs have many different endpoints. This particular one has 21 to choose from, so I played around with the live demo for a while until I figured out which ones would give me the information I wanted; in this case, it was the album_tracks and album_metadata endpoints. 

### Step 2: Getting the Parameters

Each artist, album, song, playlist, and user on Spotify has a unique identification code (URI). I found all of the URIs for each album and put them into a list so that I could iterate through them and pull in their data.

### Step 3: Pulling Data from the API

Once I had my API key and all of my albums IDs set up, I started to pull data from the API. 

```python
params = {'id': '3lS1y25WAhcqJDATJK70Mq'}
r = rq.get(base_url + endpoint_url, params=params, headers=headers, data=payload)
data = pd.DataFrame(r.json())
```
This gave me a table for the first album which, after I got down to its base level, contained a dictionary for each song with all of the information I wanted to gather. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/dictionary.jpg" alt="" style="width:600px;">

I then interated through all of the albums and put all of this data into one table, with 5 columns: Title, Album, Track Number, Play Count, and Duration in Seconds. 

### Step 4: Web Scraping Data

I also wanted to get some data about how well Taylor Swift's songs have done on the charts. I think it will be interesting to compare how the <a href="https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"> billboard rankings</a> compare to the Spotify play counts, and if they are comparable, I could use billboard rankings as an alternate response variable to play count. I'm also interested to see which songs were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_singles_discography"> singles</a> and which were made into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_videography"> music videos</a> to see if there is some relationship there.

I used the Beautiful Soup package to read and parse through the html for the Billboards Hot 100 Taylor Swift webpage, the Wikipedia page for Taylor Swift's singles, and the Wikipedia page for Taylor Swift's music videos.

```python
url = "https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/chart-history/hsi/"
r = rq.get(url)
soup = bs(r.text)
```
### Step 5: Data Cleaning and Compilation

Once I got all of the data loaded into one table, I had to do a lot of data cleaning to get the information into a format I was able to use. I won't bore you with the details, but in the end, the final dataset includes 9 variables: Title, Album, Track Number, Play Count, Duration in Seconds, Peak Chart Position, Weeks on Chart, Single, and Music Video.

## Conclusion

In this post I showed how I gathered data about Taylor Swift's discography from the Spotify API and the Billboard Hot 100's page for Taylor Swift. I am particularly interested to see where in the rankings and data my personal favorite songs fall. In my next post, I will do some exploratory data analysis to see what trends I can observe about which songs are most popular.
