*Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World* by Meredith Broussard addresses the idea of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and what that looks like in today's world. She demonstrates the difference between general AI (which we see in movies and tv shows) and narrow AI (which is what actually exists in the real world). Broussard goes on to explore different ways that we use artificial intelligence, and all of the amazing things it can do, as well as all of the ways that it falls short of our hopes and expectations. The biggest theme that Broussard wants us to take away is that it is misguided to believe that computers and artificial intelligence are the best solutions to all of our problems.

Something that Broussard talks about repeatedly is the fact that computers, artificial intelligence, and data all trace back to humans. It is not possible to have general AI as seen in Hollywood productions - our computers will never come to life or have minds of their own. Computers were invented by people, algorithms are written by people, and all data is created and collected by people. One quote from the book that I particularly liked that I think summarizes this perfectly says, "Human beings are not, and never will be, statistics."
