## Introduction

In my <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> previous post</a>, I explained how I gathered data about Taylor Swift's songs. After cleaning the data, I ended up with nine variables: 
- Title: song title
- Album: album title
- Track Number: track number on album
- Play Count: how many times the song has been played on Spotify
- Duration in Seconds: length of the song in seconds
- Peak Chart Position: the highest position the song reached on Billboard Hot 100
- Weeks on Chart: how long the song stayed on Billboard Hot 100
- Single: if the song was released as a single
- Music Video: if the song has a music video

After creating that post, I added another variable :
- Set List: if the song was played at the Eras Tour (in Las Vegas)

Now that the data has been collected, let's see what we can find!

## Comparing Measures of Popularity

The main variable I will be using as a measure of popularity is play count. However, I also have data on chart position and longevity, so let's see if these variables are comparable of if they tell us different information.

We can see that the trends here are not incredibly strong, but there is a suggestion of a relationship. Songs which were never on the charts have a decent spread across play count, but are more concentrated at lower values. There is a general trend that songs with higher play counts also had higher peak chart positions and longer chart longevity. However, this pattern is not very strong and has numerous exceptions, so it seems that we cannot use play count and chart position/duration interchangeably as popularity measures. 

## Album versus Album

As talented of a writer and singer as Taylor Swift is, not all of her albums have done as well. Let's look at how each album has performed, according to play count:

</p>

The first graph show the average play count for each album. Because there is a huge range of time (17 years) across which these albums came out, the second graph shows the average play count for each album standardized by years since release. Since the last album, Midnights, blew the other albums out of the water, the third graph is the same as the second, excluding Midnights, so that we can better see the trends.

In the first graph, we see that 1989 and Reputation have the highest average playcounts out of all the other albums. When looking at the second graph, we see that Midnights has performed exponentially better than her other albums. In the third graph, which excludes Midnights, we see that average standardized play count generally increases with each album, with the exception of the Holiday Collection and Evermore.
