## Introduction

In my <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> previous post</a>, I explained how I gathered data about Taylor Swift's songs. After cleaning the data, I ended up with nine variables: 
- Title: song title
- Album: album title
- Track Number: track number on album
- Play Count: how many times the song has been played on Spotify
- Duration in Seconds: length of the song in seconds
- Peak Chart Position: the highest position the song reached on Billboard Hot 100
- Weeks on Chart: how long the song stayed on Billboard Hot 100
- Single: if the song was released as a single
- Music Video: if the song has a music video

After creating that post, I added another variable :
- Set List: if the song was played at the Eras Tour (specifically in Glendale, Arizona)

Now that the data has been collected, let's see what we can find!

## Comparing Measures of Popularity

The main variable I will be using as a measure of popularity is play count. However, I also have data on chart position and longevity, so let's see if these variables are comparable of if they tell us different information.

</p>

We can see that the trends here are not incredibly strong, but there is a suggestion of a relationship. Songs which were never on the charts have a decent spread across play count, but are more concentrated at lower values. There is a general trend that songs with higher play counts also had higher peak chart positions and longer chart longevity. However, this pattern is not very strong and has numerous exceptions, so it seems that we cannot use play count and chart position/duration interchangeably as popularity measures. 

## Album versus Album

As talented of a writer and singer as Taylor Swift is, not all of her albums have done as well. Let's look at how each album has performed, according to play count:

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/album-count-11.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/album-count-22.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/album-count-33.jpg" style="width:250px" />
</p>

The first graph show the average play count for each album. Because there is a huge range of time (17 years) across which these albums came out, the second graph shows the average play count for each album standardized by years since release. Since the last album, Midnights, blew the other albums out of the water, the third graph is the same as the second, excluding Midnights, so that we can better see the trends.

In the first graph, we see that 1989 and Reputation have the highest average playcounts out of all the other albums. When looking at the second graph, we see that Midnights has performed exponentially better than her other albums. In the third graph, which excludes Midnights, we see that average standardized play count generally increases with each album, with the exception of the Holiday Collection and Evermore.

## Track Number

Let's look now at how track number plays into things.

  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/single-track.jpg" style="width:400px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/track-peak.jpg" style="width:400px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/track-weeks.jpg" style="width:400px" /> 
</p>

Looking at these images, we see that songs which come earlier in the album are played more often, peak higher on the charts, and stay somewhat longer on the charts. Also, all songs have a relatively equal chance of being made into a music video, according to track number.

## Singles and Videos

Out of all of her songs, Taylor Swift chooses some songs to specifically release as singles, and some to make into music videos. Let's see how these two relate, and they relate to play count in turn.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/single-v-video.jpg" alt="" style="width:400px;">

This chart is not overly informative, but it tells us that there was only one song made into a music video that was not a single, and there were many singles which were not made into music videos.

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/video-play.jpg" style="width:400px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/single-play.jpg" style="width:400px" /> 
</p>

In these graphs, we see that songs which were made into music videos have a higher median and larger range than songs which were not. The same pattern emerges for songs which were or were not released as singles. In both cases, however, there is an outlier in the non-music-video/non-single categories.

## Set List

In Taylor Swift's most recent tour, called the Eras Tour, she played songs from all of her albums. Let's take a look and see if there is any rhyme or reason to the songs she picked.

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/single-v-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/video-v-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/peak-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/weeks-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/track-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmoore02/my386blog/main/assets/images/blog3b/play-set.jpg" style="width:250px" />
</p>

It seems that there is no relationship between whether a song is a single or if it was made into a music video and if it was included in the Eras Tour set list. She played songs which peaked higher on the charts, lasted longer on the charts, came earlier on the album, and which had higher play counts.

## Most Popular Songs

As a final exploration into the data, let's just see which are her top 15 most popular songs.

## Conclusion

Now that we've looked into all of the variables and some of the relationships between them, in my next post I will be writing fully what story this data tells us. Be sure to tune in!
