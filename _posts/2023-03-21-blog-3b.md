## Introduction

In my <a href="https://kbmoore02.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/14/blog-3a.html"> previous post</a>, I explained how I gathered data about Taylor Swift's songs. After cleaning the data, I ended up with nine variables: 
- Title: song title
- Album: album title
- Track Number: track number on album
- Play Count: how many times the song has been played on Spotify
- Duration in Seconds: length of the song in seconds
- Peak Chart Position: the highest position the song reached on Billboard Hot 100
- Weeks on Chart: how long the song stayed on Billboard Hot 100
- Single: if the song was released as a single
- Music Video: if the song has a music video

After creating that post, I added another variable :
- Set List: if the song was played at the Eras Tour (in Las Vegas)

Now that the data has been collected, let's see what we can find!

## Comparing Measures of Popularity

The main variable I will be using as a measure of popularity is play count. However, I also have data on chart position and longevity, so let's see if these variables are comparable of if they tell us different information.

We can see that the trends here are not incredibly strong, but there is a suggestion of a relationship. Songs which were never on the charts have a decent spread across play count, but are more concentrated at lower values.
